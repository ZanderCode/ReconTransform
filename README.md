# ReconTransform

Attempts to synchronize physics-based objects in unity.

Do not use for competitive games. This package is to be used in casual co-op games where enemies and other physics objects need to be just close enough between client instances.


## Setup

-Package manager > Install netcode for game objects from unity registry
-Package manager > add git repo for Steamworks using https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/multiplayer-community-contributions.git?path=/Transports/com.community.netcode.transport.facepunch
